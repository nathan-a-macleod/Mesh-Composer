# Javascript-3D-Modeling-Program
This is a very basic 3D program made in javascript with the three.js library. When it is finished, you should be able to do basic 3d box-modeling from primative shapes, change the colors of the object, and export the asset.

Right now it is probably 20-25% completed in terms of features. A few more things to add would be thr ability to do basic 3d modeling, and eventually being able to export an asset you have created.

# Contributing
I am quite new to **WEBGL** and  **THREE.JS**, so I would be grateful if you were able to contribute in any way! Before you do, please see if there is anything you could help with in the `issues` section, but if you would prefer to do something else, please open a new issue, and assign yourself to it. If you want to work on an issue, please comment on the issue, and I will assign you to it, so that I can keep things organised.
If there is an issue you want to work on that already has someone else assigned, then I may or may not assign you to it, depending on what the status is.
**Obviously**, you need to comment on an issue - and if you have been assigned to that issue - you need to fork the repo, change it and do a pull request if you would like to contribute.

Also, there is an issue for any questions or comments you would like to ask.
