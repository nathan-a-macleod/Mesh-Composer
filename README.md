# Javascript-3D-Modeling-Program
This is a very basic 3D program made in javascript with the three.js library, that I started on the 6th of April 2020. When it is finished, you should be able to do basic 3d box-modeling from primative shapes, customise the colours and materials of the object, and export the asset.

Right now it is probably 20-25% completed in terms of features. A few more things to add would be the ability to do basic 3d modeling, on option to share your 3d model to a database - anyone browsing the site would be able to preview, and eventually being able to export an asset you have created. Here is the live GitHub pages deployment:

# Contributing
I am quite new to **WEBGL** and  **THREE.JS**, so I would be grateful if you were able to contribute in any way. If you would like to fix an already existing issue, please comment on it asking to fix it so that I can assign you to it and keep things organised.

If you would like to fix an issue (or add a new feature, etc) regarding an issue that hasn't been created yet, then you are welcome to create an issue and fix it.

Also, there is an issue for any questions or comments you would like to ask.
